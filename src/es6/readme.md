# Generic Javascript ES6 concepts

#### Descrturing
- case 1

#### Spreading
- when ...var is spread the value in it is spread
- when ...{obj} is spread the object is spread out
- spreading ...({}) is same as ...{}

#### Object specific
- {abc} is same as {abc: abc} 

#### Promise
- Promises are asynchronus. If there are two promises in a call both can get executed in mixed order
- if promises are chained it stops execution at the first promise that is rejected else will execute all promises in chain
